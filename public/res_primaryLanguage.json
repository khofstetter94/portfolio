      "description": "Hello, my name is KC Hofstetter and I am a software developer from Seattle, WA. Previously, I worked as a dental hygienist for 5 years before I made the switch to tech. The healthcare field provides their employees with some really important professional skills, including communication, teamwork, patience, emotional intelligence, and extremely detail oriented work. However, the dental world was a dead end for me professionally. My ideal career wouldnâ€™t allow me to become stagnant, so I chose to move into software development as a way to provide myself with more opportunities and to challenge myself daily. I would love to be a part of a team that focuses on collaboration and community, while producing products that help with user interaction with the web and accessibility.",
